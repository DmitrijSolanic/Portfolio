# TSLA Stock Portfolio Dashboard

Dashboard [link](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/f827e453-e0fb-4359-82fe-1719df23bdec).

### What is it? 

A simplified version of my personal stock portfolio dashboard for the $TSLA stock. 

### What is the purpose of this? Is all this data not already available at your broker's portal?

My portfolio is scattered between multiple brokers, so the only way to view it in its entirety is for me to assemble positions in one common dataset first. 

### What is the data source?

This [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18QlFexDs0W8WO92ua7nulOlClWmA1hEe-OiuxRsv4Os/edit?usp=sharing). Columns A:E are filled in manually by me whenever I open a position. Columns F:M are calculated automatically.
